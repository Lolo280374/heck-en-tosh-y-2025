  # Hackintosh Project for Asus Tuf Gaming FX705GD
  <br/>
  very legal way of bringing macOS Monterey (or any version for that manner) to your ASUS TUF GAMING FX705GD laptop
  <br/><br/>
</p>

<!-- Disclaimer -->
<br/><h2 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>

This EFI will only work for the **Asus Tuf Gaming FX705GD** laptop **ONLY**. The reason I'm sharing this EFI is because it works on my machine.

Attempting to use this EFI on your Asus Tuf Gaming FX705GD (or any laptop for that matter) can lead to an unstable system, and unexpected issues may occur. I take no responsibility for any damage, data loss, or malfunction caused by the use of this project. Proceed at your own risk.

For legal reasons, the releases will only contain the EFI for this Hackintosh, and not the macOS Installer files. You can grab them at Dortania's Guide however.

<br/><h3 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è</h3>
Don't forget to map your USB ports with something such as USBMap to make sure Bluetooth, webcam, and USB ports are correctly working.
Don't forget to also generate a SMBIOS and putting the correct values according to it in the config.plist. The system probably won't boot without you doing that.

- ‚úÖ - Works as intended, tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è - In development, or fix in progress
- ‚ùå - Broken, may be fixed
- ‚õî - Incompatible, won't be fixed

| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `Sleep/Wake/Shutdown`  | ‚úÖ             | Works perfectly fine. |
| `AirDrop`  | ‚ö†Ô∏è             | Works at times, depends of the iDevice you are trying to AirDrop with (Bluetooth is finnicky) |
| `FaceTime/iMessage`  | ‚úÖ             | Personally for me it works, might not work for you, random lmao |
| `AirPlay`  | ‚úÖ             | Works too thanks to the WiFi compatibility (even tho it might break sometimes) |

<br/><h3 align="center">‚ÑπÔ∏è Info about components with compatibility issues</h3>

<h3 align="center">GPU</h3>

#### Support for the eGPU of this laptop will never be here due to the simple fact that Apple has stopped releasing NVIDIA drivers altogether as macOS High Sierra released.

<h3 align="center">Wi-Fi/Bluetooth</h3>

#### WiFi and Bluetooth on macOS Monterey with Intel cards is very finnicky due to the fact that Intel hasn't released official drivers for macOS, so it's purely based on Community Support. Due to that fact, drivers exists, but they aren't at this top level that you'll get support for everything such as AirDrop, or AirPlay perfectly. It might work fine, or not. I would recommend investing in a supported WiFi chipset and Bluetooth dongle if you really want that functionality.

<h3 align="center">Keyboard</h3>

#### Although the keyboard itself works, the main issues are with FN keys mapping and Keyboard backlight (especially after waking up from sleep).

<h3 align="center">Fans</h3>

#### Fans will work normally but however, you won't be able to get speed readings at all or control them within macOS.
